### *summary*
---


Unblur takes quite a few options, and is used to align movie frames. It also:
1) May apply a gain or dark reference.
2) May resample the images.
3) Removes statistical outliers.

Works with MRC and TIFF files. EER support is only available in the newer alpha versions.

 
```{note}

Unblur can be easily run from the *cis*TEM GUI, so if you are intrested please look at the [source code.](https://github.com/timothygrant80/cisTEM/blob/5640501813923294613390124c8a2056f6af54f8/src/programs/unblur/unblur.cpp#L67-L184)
