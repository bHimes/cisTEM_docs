# Git Workflow
----------------------------------------
After you have decided which repository to fork from (link to Getting started/Project organization) you will want to create your own local repository.

### Git basics

* Local repo is entirely independent of the remote
* Instruc on forking
* Master/dev -- you won't work on directly
* Create branch of dev (command)
* do work, test - create PR into dev on your remote

* frequently pull back in to update your development branch -- commands, explain rebase and link
